# MySimplifiedSQL
An easy-to-use PHP class to interact with a SQL database.

Currently the script uses the MySQLi extension (supports MySQL/MariaDB), support for PDO is one of the main ideas.

See the examples to get started. If you want to properly handle errors make sure to use try/catch statements (not included in examples).
